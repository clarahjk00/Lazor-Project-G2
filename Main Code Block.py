""" 
Lazor Project

This program solves the Lazor Game by:
    Parsing board configuration files (.bff format)
    Simulating laser paths through different block types (reflect, opaque, and refract)
    Finding vaid block placements that makes lasers hit all the targets
    Outputting the solution to a file 

Uses object-oriented design with class structures.
