# Lazor Game Solver

"Lazors" is a puzzle game available on Android and iPhone. The player (you!) places blocks on the board to guide the laser beam to hit specific targets by placing blocks with special functions: block, reflection, refraction, and transparent.

The free version of the game provides only three hints. So, are you stuck with a problematic board? You don't have any free hints left? No way you can solve the puzzle on your own? It's okay—we've got you!



### ⚙️How to use:

When you cannot solve a particular board, make your .bff file and use "Main Code Block.py" to solve it.

The .bff file needs to start with the board structure you want to solve. Write down the board between the GRID START and the GRID STOP. For example:

```
GRID START
o B x o o
o o o o o
o x o o o
o x o o x
o o x x o
B o x o o
GRID STOP
```

Each block needs to be represented with x for no blocks allowed, o for blocks allowed, A for reflect block, B for opaque block, and C for refract block. In the board representation, include all the fixed blocks!

The horizontal direction is the x-axis (right for +ve), and the vertical direction is the y-axis (down for +ve).

Next, we specify the number of blocks we have. For example:

```
A 8
```

Use the same notation as the board representation (A, B, and C).

Now, we need to have a laser to solve the laser game. The lazor is denoted as L in the .bff file with two numbers representing start coordinates followed by two numbers representing the direction. For example:

```
L 4 1 1 1
```

Lastly, the .bff file should contain the coordinates of the point at which the laser needs to intersect. In the Lazor game, it will be a circle at the border of the block. For example:

```
P 6 9
P 9 2
```

After compiling all the necessary parts into the .bff file, **voila!** You are ready to get the solution! 
Scroll down to the end and edit input_file and output_file on "Main Code Block.py". For example:

```
input_file = 'whatever.bff'
output_file = 'whatever_solution.txt'
```

*Make sure the full file name goes between ' '. Input file should end with .bff and output file should end with .txt*

Run the code and get the file!

*We used yarn_5.bff as an example of structuring the .bff file. Check the file if you are unsure how to compile all the necessary parts!*



### 🎉What you will get:

Unless the board is super complicated or big, the solution will be given within 2 minutes. The code will provide {original bff file name}_solution.txt. Open it, use it, and the puzzle is solved!
